 */

// This is a placeholder for the jsQR library
// In a real implementation, you would include the full jsQR library
// For now, this provides a basic structure

function jsQR(data, width, height, options = {}) {
  // This is a simplified mock implementation
  // In production, replace this with the actual jsQR library

  // Basic pattern detection (very simplified)
  // This won't actually work for real QR codes
  // You need to include the real jsQR library

  return null // Return null if no QR code found
}

// To use the real jsQR library:
// 1. Download jsQR.js from https://github.com/cozmo/jsQR
// 2. Replace this file with the actual jsQR.js
// 3. Or include it via CDN in your HTML (not recommended for extensions)
